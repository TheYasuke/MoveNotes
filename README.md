# MoveNotes
Moves notes from one powerpoint slide to another given they have similar content.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very niche script few will care about.

Script is originally designed for those who teach with a slide deck that is constantly updated by their organization.

Given two powerpoints with similar content, it will transfer the notes of one powerpoint to the other. Slides are transferred based on matching titles.

Created because I was tired of transferring notes by hand everytime a slide deck was updated.

Uses python3

Usage:

python movenotes.py [new ppt with no custom notes] [old ppt with custom notes]

**ex-**
**python movenotes.py updatePPT.pptx oldPPT.pptx**


Note: Ensure updatedPPT is NOT open
